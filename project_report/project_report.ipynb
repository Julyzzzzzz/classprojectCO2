    "The rapid rise of greenhouse gases emissions is a problem because it causes global warming and changes the climate faster than many living things can adapt to. Carbon dioxide (CO2) makes up the vast majority of greenhouse gas emissions. This project will analyze real CO2 emission data over 40 years in the U.S. with Python and present visualized data and statistical analysis results. Visualized data of the rise pattern and regional pattern of CO2 emission over a few decades across the U.S. can help us to understand the CO2 emissions better and take effective measures. A decision tree model that can predict CO2 emission based on population, geographic region, and the year is also important for us to determine if it is getting better or under control. By introducing hypothesis testing, we can find out if the data collected in Washington state could well present the national data which will give us a better idea on generalizing state date to national data."

In order to do it, I obtained all the CO2 emissions data of Washington state from the pretreated data.

I did a lot of data cleaning in order to get all the necessary data for plotting. The pie chart would show how much each fuel contributed to the total CO2 emission in the country in 2017 and 10 years ago and how the ratio has changed.\n",

Therefore, I will have to build a new data frame with labels of population, geographic region of the state, year, and corresponding CO2 emission values to build a decision tree model and optimize the model by adjusting the max tree depth. I used sklearn library to build a decision and separate the data to 20% and 80%. Test and train errors (mean squared error) were evaluated and plotted against maximum tree depth. At the end, the decision tree was optimized by changing the maximum tree depth to improve the fit.\n"
